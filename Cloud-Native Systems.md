# Learning Cloud-Native Systems

From your notes, you’re touching on four big domains of modern cloud-native systems. Here’s how I see it, and what you should focus on learning—roughly in this order:

## 1. Containerization Fundamentals

### Docker & Images
- How to write a Dockerfile, build images, run containers.
- Image registries (Docker Hub, Hugging Face Docker Spaces).

### Stateless vs Stateful
- **Stateless**: No in-container memory between requests.
- Where to persist state: Databases, object storage.

### Serverless Containers
- The idea that you don’t manage the host machines yourself.
- Platforms: AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps.

### Key Takeaway:
- Master Docker first—build, run, push, pull—then explore a serverless container service to see how auto-scaling and infrastructure abstraction works.

---

## 2. Event-Driven & Scheduled Workloads

### CronJobs (Scheduled Tasks) vs Event-Driven
- **Cron**: Time-based tasks (e.g., “run this EDA job every night at 2 AM”).
- **Event**: Triggers from webhooks, message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ), cloud-function triggers (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

### Message Brokers
- Basics of pub/sub, queues, at-least-once delivery, partitioning.

### Key Takeaway:
- Experiment by wiring a small container to consume from a test Kafka/RabbitMQ queue, and write a second container that runs on a schedule using Kubernetes CronJob.

---

## 3. Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Patterns

### Core Concepts
- **Pods**: Grouping of one or more containers.
- **Deployments**: Management of replicas and scaling.
- **Services**: Networking within Kubernetes.
- **Replication**: Horizontal scaling and rolling updates.

### Sidecar Pattern
- Attaching helper containers (e.g., Dapr sidecar) to handle cross-cutting concerns (service invocation, state management).

### Dapr
- How Dapr abstracts pub/sub, state stores, bindings via YAML.

### CI/CD Automation
- GitOps (Argo CD, Flux), Helm charts, Kustomize.

### Key Takeaway:
- Run a tiny microservice in Kubernetes locally (e.g., with minikube or kind), add a Dapr sidecar, and see how traffic flows and scaling works.

---

## 4. Cloud Deployment & Scaling Strategies

### Environments & Platforms
- **Local development** → Docker Spaces (free) → Azure Container Apps (free & paid tiers) → Google EKS (planet-scale) → Oracle Cloud VMs.

### Cost & Access
- Free tiers vs paid plans; when to move from hobby to production.

### Observability
- Logging (ELK/EFK stack), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), tracing (Jaeger).

### Key Takeaway:
- Push the same container image through a pipeline: local → free hosting → managed Kubernetes → observe costs, latency, and log aggregation.

## Putting it all together:

1. Start with Docker → build a simple stateless web service.
2. Add a schedule (K8s CronJob) → generate a report.
3. Switch to event-driven → hook it up to Kafka or AWS SNS/Lambda.
4. Container orchestration → deploy to minikube, scale via replicas.
5. Sidecars & Dapr → externalize state and pub/sub.
6. CI/CD & GitOps → automate your deployments.
7. Cloud rollout → test on free tiers, then production-grade clusters.
8. Monitoring & Resilience → instrument, test failures, auto-heal.

---

## Next steps:

Pick one small project—say, a “to-do” API—and containerize it. Then add:

- A CronJob that emails you daily summaries.
- A Kafka topic that logs user actions.
- A Kubernetes deployment with 2 replicas.
- A Dapr sidecar for state storage.

That exercise alone will touch all the core areas in your notes. Once you’ve built it, you’ll know exactly which piece you enjoyed most (containers? orchestration? eventing?), and can dive deeper from there.
